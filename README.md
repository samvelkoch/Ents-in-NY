### Background

Work for a nonprofit organization advising the planning department on ways to improve the quantity and quality of trees in New York City. The urban design team believes tree size (using trunk diameter as a proxy for size) and health are the most desirable characteristics of city trees. The city would like to learn more about which tree species are the best choice to plant on the streets of Manhattan.

### Challenge

Create a report that covers the following:

- What are the most common tree species in Manhattan?
- Which are the neighborhoods with the most trees?
- A visualization of Manhattan's neighborhoods and tree locations.
- What ten tree species would you recommend the city plant in the future?
